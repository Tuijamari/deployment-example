 <h2>Web Security</h2>
 <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential 
client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the 
word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
 <p id="web-security-answer">[Report about web security:
As a front- end developer, I need you to understand the importance of web security. 
I have learned from the Noroff school that it is important to keep in mind the three S:s when 
choosing a hosting webservice. The three S:s are good speed, reliable security and support 
which is easy to reach at the hosting service. Web security is something that must be up to 
date, but can be medium priced.
There are various kinds of hosting services like shred host which are used by small companies. 
Then the host is shared with other users. This is the cheapest verson of web security, but not 
always the best. 
Other versions are VPS host services for your private use, which we can offer for you, because 
my husband works with this kind of issue. You can also choose cloud hosting services or private 
hosting services, which are most expensive. They are often used by bigger companies with a lot 
of data to save. 
There are a lot of security systems to take on use either manually on your own VPS or from web 
services. It is not only the home page which is important to secure, but also the connection 
between you and your clients, your files, and documents you are sharing on the web. These can 
be attacked by other users on the web. 
As a front- end developer, I need to advise you to Worths eventually web attracts. To think 
about your web security is as important as mine. It is important to me that you can rely on me
as a secure and service minded front end- developer.
With best Regards, Tuijamari Helgeland
